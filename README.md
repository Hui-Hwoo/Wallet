# Wallet


A web application for keeping track of daily expenses, and virtualizing the transaction datas to creat a healthy habit of consumption. 

Built with node.js, Express.js and HTML5 and some other libraries to add more functionalities and practicality. 
- Express-validator: to verify data type and value before inserting mongodb
- Bcryptjs: to encrypt user's password and other private data
- jsonwebtoken: for user authentication


## Wanna a try?
1. npm install (in terminal) to download all necessary library
2. get mongodb url (recommend mongodb Atlas)
3. npm start (in terminal) to start backend
4. use Chrome or other browser to show frontend pages

# Code Review by Harshit Gajjar
Great Job on your application!! I tried running the application but had found issues with it.
The instructions given to run the app on readme didn't work. 
I think all the points from canvas rubric are not covered expecially with folder structure. I tried modifying the code a little to make it run but i was getting errors on create account page.

Overall, hats off for all your efforts on the project.
